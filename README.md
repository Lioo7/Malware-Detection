## About
We are two students who are interested in the field of cybersecurity and malware detection. As part of our studies, we have implemented the innovative algorithm developed by Keehyung Kim and Byung-Ro Moon for detecting script malware, which is described in their paper ["Malware Detection based on Dependency Graph using Hybrid Genetic Algorithm"](http://rosaec.snu.ac.kr/publish/2010/T2/KiMo-GECCO-2010.pdf). This type of malware has become a major threat in recent years due to the widespread use of scripting in a variety of programs, and it can be difficult to detect due to its polymorphic nature.

The algorithm developed by Keehyung Kim and Byung-Ro Moon uses dependency graph analysis and maximum subgraph isomorphism to identify the core logical structures of script malware, even when it is polymorphic. It also includes efficient heuristic approaches that improve detection accuracy and reduce computational cost. In experiments, this algorithm has shown superior detection accuracy compared to state-of-the-art antivirus software.

We are excited to have had the opportunity to work with this algorithm and to contribute to the field of malware detection. We hope that our website will provide a useful resource for others who are interested in this important topic. Thank you for visiting, and we hope you will come back often to learn more about our work and the latest updates in the field.
